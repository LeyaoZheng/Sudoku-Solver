# Sudoku Solver

A Sudoku solver implemented in Racket using recursive backtracking to explore valid solution states efficiently.

## Features
- Solves standard 9×9 Sudoku puzzles  
- Uses recursive backtracking to explore candidate solutions  
- Prunes invalid states using row, column, and subgrid constraints  
- Achieves solution times of approximately 2.8 seconds under typical conditions  

## Technical Details
- Written in Racket  
- Employs functional programming principles  
- Uses constraint checking to reduce the search space  

## Motivation
This project was built to practice recursion, functional abstraction, and constraint-based problem solving in a functional programming environment.

## Future Improvements
- Performance optimization using heuristics  
- Support for alternative Sudoku sizes  
- Visualization of solving steps
